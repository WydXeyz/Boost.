Thank you for purchasing Boost Crew's Boost Bot Source Code!

As we have said about setting up support, for extra support we have made an file for you 
to setup yourself.

1) Setup your config.json

2) Edit your bot.py, rebrand it if you would like to.

3) If you would like to add tokens, go to input folder and you should see 3m_tokens &
1m_tokens.

4) Once you finished, go to cmd and do python bot.py, make sure to have python installed

Shortly, the bot should be online. Any issues please DM $vapo#0001 with your error.
